Hello there, here is some text. It is very nice. I wonder what it will look like in both the light and dark mode of the homepage.
```html
<div>Hello, here is some HTML.</div>
```
Here is some C-code.
```c
int main(void){
    return 0;
}
```
Here is Julia code!
```julia
function foo()
    x = rand()
    return x^2
end
```
Here is some shell code.
```sh
$ ./hello
```
